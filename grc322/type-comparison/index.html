			<h1>Franklin Gothic </h1> <h3> vs. </h3> <h2> Trade Gothic </h2>
             <h3>History of each typeface</h3>

			 <h1>Franklin Gothic</h1> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Franklin Gothic was designed in the early years of the 20th century by the type foundry American Type Founders. It is thereby credited to the head designer Morris Fuller Benton. He was based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and completed 221 typefaces in his career, including Garamond 3, Bank Gothic, and Century Schoolbook. The font had a hiatus in popularity in the 1930s but then was rediscovered by American designers in the 1940s and has remained popular since. It was named in honor of Benjamin Franklin and his involvement in printing. Franklin owned a printing shop in Philadelphia. The shop printed all kinds of things including Pennsylvania's currency, his own newspaper, the Pennsylvania Gazette, and the Poor Richard's Almanac. For the rest of his life, regardless of his other accomplishments, Benjamin considered himself a printer. </p>
             
			 <h2>Trade Gothic</h2> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Trade Gothic was designed in 1948 by Jackson Burke, an American type designer from San Francisco. "Gothic" was a popular term during this time, meaning sans serif. This is because there was a negative reaction to sans serif fonts when they first appeared, which led to them being called grotesque (ugly) and gothic (barbaric). The font family has three weights and three widths. Originally just referred to as "gothic," the current name was given to the font because it was often used for what was then referred to as "trade" or "jobbing" work. It is thinner and has more distinctive letter shapes than other sans serif fonts.It is used notably by Vice magazine and Amnesty International. </p>
