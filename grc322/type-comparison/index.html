			<h1>Franklin Gothic vs. Trade Gothic </h1>

             <h3>History of each typeface</h3>
			
			

			 <h2>Franklin Gothic</h2> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Franklin Gothic was designed in the early years of the 20th century by the type foundry American Type Founders. It is thereby credited to the head designer Morris Fuller Benton. He was based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and completed 221 typefaces in his career, including Garamond 3, Bank Gothic, and Century Schoolbook. The font had a hiatus in popularity in the 1930s but then was rediscovered by American designers in the 1940s and has remained popular since. It was named in honor of Benjamin Franklin and his involvement in printing. Franklin owned a printing shop in Philadelphia. The shop printed all kinds of things including Pennsylvania's currency, his own newspaper, the Pennsylvania Gazette, and the Poor Richard's Almanac. For the rest of his life, regardless of his other accomplishments, Benjamin considered himself a printer. </p>

			 <h2>Trade Gothic</h2> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Trade Gothic was designed in 1948 by Jackson Burke, an American type designer from San Francisco. The font family has three weights and three widths. Originally just referred to as "gothic," its current name was given to the font because it was often used for what was then referred to as "trade" or "jobbing" work. It is thinner and has more distinctive letter shapes than other sans serif fonts. It is used notably by Vice magazine and Amnesty International. </p>

			<h3>Comparison</h3>

			<h3>Similarities</h3>

				<img src="images/similarities.jpg"
					 alt="Examples of letterforms from both fonts next to one another.">
				<figcaption>Both fonts are sans serif with similar letter styles. They are clearly inspired by the same concept. Fonts of this nature were popularized by Bauhaus, an influential art and design movement that began in 1919 in Weimar, Germany. The Bauhaus movement championed a geometric, abstract style featuring little sentiment or emotion and no historical nods. Its aesthetic continues to influence architects, designers and artists. </figcaption>

				<img src="images/analysis.png"
					 alt="An analysis of the different aspects of gothic sans-serif letterforms.">
				<figcaption>Both fonts fall under the classification of "gothic" or "grotesque" sans-serif fonts. This is not to be confused with the blackletter-style gothic fonts of early printing. "Gothic" was used to describe Sans Serifs initially because they took a fairly severe departure from the then current trend of Roman type traditions with very humanist forms based on centuries of perfection throughout antiquity & their revival during the Italian Renaissance. That and early Sans Serifs were rather unrefined and illegible, but we now see them as clean and modern.</figcaption>

				<img src="images/diff2.png"
					 alt="Comparison of three different letters from each font.">
				<figcaption> Trade Gothic has more slanted lines in its letter forms, whereas Franklin Gothic has more horizontally inspired lines in its typography. Note the A's and J's. The Q's are also different in these two fonts. In Franklin Gothic, the tail of the Q does not pass through the central O form. Trade Gothic's does.</figcaption>
